# Auto Lead Catcher 
# (Real-time Lead Collection + Instant Email Alert using AWS)

# The Problem

Imagine this:

You run a website.  
A potential customer fills your contact form and gone.

No message. No email. No trace.

Leads were silently disappearing every day.  
That’s not just sad — it’s costly.

# The Idea

Let’s build a cloud-based “lead catcher” that:
1. Stores every form entry safely in a database (forever).
2. Sends you an instant email the moment someone contacts you.
3. Works with any website, landing page, or even Postman.

No more leads getting lost.  
No more manual checking.  
Just peace of mind.

# Here’s how the automation works:

# Results
1. Every lead is stored
2. Email reaches instantly
3. All fully serverless — pay only when used
